        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have been working in a corporate environment since I was 16. Here are some of the things I have picked up.
        This page is intended to share my feelings about each company and role. To see my formal resume, use the link
        below.</p>

        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Business Career Center - Marriott School of Management</h3>
            <img class="resume_img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c9/BYU_Marriott_School_of_Management_logo.svg/1280px-BYU_Marriott_School_of_Management_logo.svg.png" alt="Marriott School Logo">
            <p class="experience_description">I started as an assistant to Reid Grawe, the placement counselor for the
            Information Systems program. After 2.5 years, I ended up as the team lead for all technology projects for the
            Business Career Center. It was a great experience to be in the know about job and internship opportunities, and
            to help my classmates acheive their employment dreams. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Workday</h3>
            <img class="resume_img" src="http://logonoid.com/images/workday-logo.png" alt="Workday Logo">
            <p class="experience_description">As an Application Developer Intern, I had the opportunity to work with a
            great team of people. I truly believe that the people you surround yourself with are key to being happy. I
            loved my co-workers and I look forward to joining my Workday team full-time in July 2016 </p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience">
            <h3>USAA</h3>
            <img class="resume_img" src="http://www.debtroundup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/usaa_logo.jpg" alt="USAA Logo">
            <p class="experience_description">I can't say enough positive things about my time as an intern at USAA.
            Serving the members of the United States Armed Forces is an experience I will never forget. While at USAA, I
            had the opportunity to participate in a mock "Zero-day PT" where you are treated like a brand new cadet at
            bootcamp. Hundreds of push-ups and a few miles later, I gained a deeper appreciation for our servicemen and women.</p>

        <div class="experience">
            <h3>Signet Mortgage Corporation</h3>
            <img class="resume_img" src="https://www.newswire.com/files/da/23/68c40ee74d198978f67e4baf1e2b.jpg" alt="Signet Mortgage Logo">
            <p class="experience_description">My first office job was working for my dad at Signet. As the founder and
            president of this little Mortgage company, my dad gave me a lot of responsibilities, many of which I wasn't
            qualified for. I ran the books for a while, served as the "tech guy" and developed custom reports for government
            compliance reporting. It was a great opportunity to get involved in multiple facets of a company and has
            shaped my understanding of how a business operates.</p>
